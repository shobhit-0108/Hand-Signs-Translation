# Hand-Signs-Translation
A residual Neural Network is used to translate hand signs to numbers.The signs dataset is available on Kaggle
Deep convolutional networks, using Residual Networks (ResNets). 
In theory, very deep networks can represent very complex functions; 
but in practice, they are hard to train. Residual Networks, allow us to train much deeper networks than were previously practically feasible.
